    <h2>I am invested in Art!</h2>
    <p>My intrest and passion in art does not neccisarily come from a
       admiration of the act of drawing or painting, but from what worlds
       and stories that I can create with them and bring to life. So I am
       interested in any way and medium that can let me express my stories!
       Which brings on part two.</p>
    <h2 style = "text-align: right;">I am invested in CS!</h2>
    <p id = "right_paragraph">To me CS has a similar appeal as art does as I can create something
       that I envision according to my desires. I enjoy it also as a form
       of puzzle solving that keeps me entertained in the process and I hope
       to combine the two interests which currently may be game design
       or animation.</p>
    <h2 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 60px">Here are some pieces of
       art I made a few months ago!</h2>
